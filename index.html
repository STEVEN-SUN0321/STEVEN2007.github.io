    <h1>Information Security</h1>
    <p>We are now living in the information age. Information has become one of the most important properties for individuals, companies, and even countries. With the popularization of the Internet and the rapid development of technology, the sharing and storage of information have become more convenient than ever before. However, this convenience also brings unprecedented risks. Information security is a key means to protect data from unauthorized access, use, tampering, or destruction. Whether it is to prevent personal privacy leakage or to protect corporate secrets, information security plays a vital role in modern society. This paper will explore the main threats to information security, current protection measures, and possible challenges in this field in the future.</p>

    <p>With the advancement of technology and the popularization of the Internet, information security faces more and more threats. These threats not only come from technical vulnerabilities but also include human attacks and social engineering methods. Cyber attacks are one of the most common threats. Hackers use malware, viruses, and other means to illegally access systems and networks in order to steal, tamper with, or destroy data. For example, Kaseya, a US-based remote management software provider, suffered a supply chain attack that became public on July 2, 2021. The company announced that attackers were able to exploit its VSA product to infect customer machines with ransomware. Shortly after the attack, news reports said that 800-1500 small and medium-sized companies were infected with REvil ransomware as a result of the attack. <a href="http://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/cyber-attack/">What Is a Cyber Attack | Types Examples & Prevention | Imperva</a>. Moreover, Chinese aircraft parts maker FACC lost nearly $60 million in a so-called "CEO fraud scam," in which scammers posed as top executives and tricked employees into transferring funds. <a href="http://www.tessian.com/blog/examples-of-social-engineering-attacks/">11 Social Engineering Examples - Real Attacks - Updated 2021 | Tessian</a>.</p>

    <p>As a result, more and more people know the importance of information security. In order to respond to increasingly complex information security threats, we are taking a lot of methods to figure out these problems. For instance, governments make laws to prevent these issues. The <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/annualstatutes/2015_32/page-1.html">Digital Privacy Act SC 2015 Chapter 32</a> provides for the criminalization of breaches of certain obligations relating to breaches of security safeguards. Education departments also take action to improve the awareness of information security. The disclosure of education records is generally regulated, and colleges may not disclose personally identifiable information from a student's education records without the student's prior consent. <a href="https://policies.mit.edu/policies-procedures/110-privacy-and-disclosure-personal-information/113-privacy-student-records">Privacy of Student Records | MIT Policies</a>.</p>

    <p>Overall, in the face of increasingly complex threats, a multi-level protection system combining law, education, and other aspects is particularly important. In my opinion, we should enhance the protection of information security due to the various methods of cyber attack. And future information security still has broad development prospects. If we pay more attention to this aspect through worldwide cooperation, continuous innovation, and so on, we can create a safer and more private world for future generations.</p>
